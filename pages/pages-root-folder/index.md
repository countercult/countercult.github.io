# image: widget-1-302x182.jpg
  text: "The Counter Cult challenges the growing influence of effective altruist and longtermist movements, and the unfounded hype around the emergence of 'super- intelligence' propagated by the dominant players in the tech-industry. It provides and promote new technological (open source) solutions, different conceptions of digital technologies, and advice tailored to your and your communities' needs."
widget2:
  title: "Who we are"
  url: '/people/'
  text: "We are a group of researchers working across the fields of computational linguistics, AI and history of science. We have come together because we think governments and their citizens are being wrongly informed about machine intelligence and its potential impact on the world. With years of experience in fields related to computer science, we feel in an ideal position to correct misconceptions."
