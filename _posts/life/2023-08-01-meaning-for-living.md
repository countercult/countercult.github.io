## Paradigms and meaning

In 1970, Margaret Masterman, the founder of the Cambridge Language Research Unit, wrote a critique of Thomas Kuhn’s *Structure of Scientific Revolutions*, taking apart his notion of ‘paradigm’. The argument was that Kuhn had carelessly used the word in 21 different senses in his work, making the notion completely unsuitable to describe the historical processes that occupy the core of his book. Kuhn revised his manuscript in response to Masterman’s critique, and this revised version is the one we now read when approaching his famous work on scientific progress.

What is a paradigm? According to Masterman, a structure of habits within a community. Newtonian physics, for instance, was a paradigm alive in the scientific community, which was overthrown by Einstein. Democracy, anarchy and absolutist monarchy are three paradigms that can describe a political structure, but are incompatible with each other. Paradigmatic changes are essential to progress, and they usually happen when an old set of habits becomes broken: for instance, when Newtonian physics does not account anymore for the data gathered by modern instrumentation, or when the French monarchy cannot feed its people anymore. Perhaps, also, when the industrial and economic structure of a group of societies leads to irreversible climate disasters. Time will tell. What we are concerned with, in the context of semantics, is the way paradigm shifts drastically perturb meaning and bring about new worlds.

The English language has a nice expression: ‘to make sense’. But the phrase has an unfortunate use pattern, which applies it to actual things in the world: ‘this book doesn’t make sense’, ‘her suggestion makes sense’. The reason this is unfortunate is that, ultimately, things don’t make sense. We do. It is our brains that attribute particular structures to the world (which it may or may not have). It is our brains that can take the exact same set of observations – the same reality – and rearrange its meaning into a completely new set of concepts. A new possible world. Paradigm change is about making sense in a particularly revolutionary way, which kills some meanings and puts new ones in power.

Here is an example: there is a naturally-occurring mineral called ‘icosahedrite’ which shows an arrangement of atoms that does not conform to the conventional patterns we see in crystals and thus falls under the category of ‘quasicrystals’. In spite of its apparent irregularity, if you look at it not in three, but six dimensions, its structure becomes symmetric again. This is mind-boggling because, as suggested by physicist Lisa Randall, it opens the idea of a physical universe in higher dimensions. Same set of data: a mineral. Different possible world: one where crystal symmetry – and perhaps the whole entire observable universe – occupies six (or more) dimensions.

Meanings, just like crystals, can be observed from different dimensionalities. They look very different depending on the so-called ‘basis’, or set of dimensions, that we use to look at them. Some dimensionalities make more sense than others. Some, literally, generate new meanings that we had never thought of before. In order for a physicist to even think of observing quasicrystals in six dimensions, their meaning space itself must acquire the right configuration in the right set of dimensions.


## Paradigms and the human mind

We should take seriously the notion of paradigm change. Why? Because our relation to meaning matters well beyond science. After a couple of years of a deadly pandemic, climate disasters, political polarisation in numerous countries, and now, war at the European borders, people all over the planet are looking for change. Some want less dependence on fossil fuels, some wish for less, or more, capitalism; some feel increasingly uncomfortable with the particular type of democracy implemented in Western societies; many, simply, want an easier life; most are asking for ‘solutions’. 

Solutions, invariably, involve shifts in meaning. Drastic solutions involve drastic shifts. Same set of data: a society, a political structure, an economic order. Different possible world: one where reality is arranged in new (social, political, economic) concepts, incompatible with the old ones. Being aware of the mechanisms that underlie the making and undoing of our individual and collective conceptual maps can make us more aware, more resilient, but also perhaps more creative in times of uncertainty.

The problem is that we are as badly wired for paradigm change as we are for conceptualising six-dimensional crystals. In 1974, psychologists Tversky and Kahneman devised the so-called ‘dual-processing model’, describing two systems used by humans in the course of decision making: System One is thought to be automatic, unconscious, and driven by experience, while System Two is rational, conscious, and based on inference. As it encodes regular habits learned from experience, System One is much faster than System Two, and as a consequence, 95% of our cognition is routed through it. This allows us to make quick decisions in life-or-death situations, but it also leads us to overgeneralise and makes us prone to biases and prejudices, like thinking of objects in three dimensions only. Paradigm shifts, of course, break conceptual habits, and are the most spectacular incarnation of System Two. Sadly, they use that part of our cognition which we only engage with 5% of the time, and this is why we so often miss the opportunity to be truly creative.

If the human mind is limited by its own survival strategy, it would seem natural to push the burden of creativity onto machines. After all, computers have the desirable property of being unconcerned about their longevity. They are free to be rational and logical, but also to be entirely novel. So we should perhaps put our fate in AI's hands after all. Ironically, despite the reciprocal dislike of Chomskian linguistics and computational linguists for each other, state-of-the-art NLP models essentially implement the grammatical view of language advocated by Chomsky, rather than the logical, mathematical insights of Montague. As a result, they miss out on the most important aspect of the meaning faculty: thinking outside the box.

So who will come up with the next world-changing paradigm? Humans or machines? So far, humans retain their edge. But only barely, by a mere 5% of their cognition. It does not have to be this way, though, and our primal survival instincts can probably deal with a little more sense making, if we let them. This seems a good time to revise the way we think about thinking, and take meanings outside of their box.
