## Using other people's work

What do we use generative AI for? If truly wanting art, we're not in the right place. For slides, illustrations, etc: we could probably have gone on pexels or unsplash. But there was never any effort made by governments to promote CC the way they are pushing generative AI now.

Search is bad so instead of giving you the human content you need, companies prefer to create spurious content.
